# Crafting My Journey to World-Class Engineering

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to **Crafting My Journey to World-Class Engineering**. This repository documents my learning path inspired by the principles of [Ultralearning by Scott Young](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/). This roadmap is based on my research and tailored to meet my needs and interests.

This is a continuously evolving collection of modules! **The goal is to provide flexibility while maintaining clarity and focus on key learning areas.**

## 2. Why I'm Doing This

I aim to become a World-class Engineer capable of:

- Architecting and designing systems from the ground up.
- Implementing solutions in the most appropriate programming languages.
- Bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.
- Adapting to the rapidly evolving technological landscapes.
