# Crafting My Journey to a World-Class Engineering

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to **Crafting My Journey to World-Class Engineering**. This repository documents my learning path inspired by the principles of [Ultralearning by Scott Young](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/). This roadmap is based on my research and tailored to meet my needs. It will particularly focus on the amalgamation of disciplines that will likely define the Engineer of the future.

This is a continuously evolving collection of modules. Not every module will have the same structure or depth. Some might include just conceptual notes, while others may contain detailed projects, code snippets, and comprehensive explanations. 

**The goal is to provide flexibility while maintaining clarity and focus on key learning areas.**

## 2. Why I'm Doing This

My primary motivation is to push the boundaries of technology and innovation. By documenting this journey, I aim to become a World-class Engineer capable of providing solutions from architecting/designing a system from scratch to implementing it in whatever programming language proves to be the best fit.
